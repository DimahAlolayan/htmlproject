    <h1>Outcome One </h1>
    <h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    <p>Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan.<br>
        multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single
        computer, IT plays a role.<br>
        The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how
        it is being used across the business world.
    </p>
    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need
        to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h3>
    <p>For the project manager skills we need:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li> Excellent Communication Skills</li>
        </ul>
        effective communication doesn’t just happen. You have to put in the time and effort to get to know your teams
        and clients so that you can devise appropriate communication plans that connect with different personality
        types.

        <ul>
            <li> Is Detail-Oriented</li>
        </ul>
        Attention to detail is one of those things that people don’t really notice unless you haven’t got it. <br>
        However, it’s a skill that any effective project manager needs to have.
        <ul>
            <li> Very Organised</li>
        </ul>
        Being organised is not only something I personally take pride in, it’s a vital skill for a role in project
        management.
        <ul>
            <li> Works Well Under Pressure</li>
        </ul>
        Project Managers are ultimately responsible for delivering a project on time and within budget.<br>
        So, it’s important to remember how to tolerate pressure and not to become overwhelmed by it.<br><br>
        For the project tools:
        <ul>
            <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) </li>
            <li>Social Media</li>
            <li>Content Management System</li>
            <li>Slack</li>
            <li>Trello</li>
            <li>Google Docs</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your
        Trello board. </h3>
    <p>

        <ul>
            <li> Set your purpose and goals. </li>
        </ul>
        What is the purpose of your website?<br>
        Is it to gain publicity for your business? To sell your inventory? To rally support behind a cause?<br>
        It’s important to identify your website’s purpose, as well as your target audience.
        <ul>
            <li>Create a budget.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li>Assign roles.</li>
        </ul>
        Company stakeholders (owner, marketing manager, or whoever else represents a primary function of the
        business),<br>
        Web developer, Content writer and/or editor, HTML/CSS professional and Web and graphic designer
        <ul>
            <li> Create a content strategy.</li>
        </ul>
        The content will you be displaying on your website, Content is basically anything that gives your visitors
        information. <br>
        It can include, Blog posts, Documents, Video, Pictures (such as in a gallery), Slideshows and Embedded social
        media feeds (such as your Twitter stream or Facebook page updates)

        <ul>
            <li>Structure your website.</li>
        </ul>
        Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one.<br>
        Most websites have an About and Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.

        <ul>
            <li>Create a mock-up.</li>
        </ul>
        A page mock-up, also know as a wireframe, is essentially the outline of your website (with the initial design
        being the first draft).<br>
        Usually created in Photoshop or Fireworks, you don’t have to put too much detail into your mock-up. Use
        placeholder text to fill pages, and don’t worry about details.<br>
        This is just to give everyone an idea of what the website will look like.
        <ul>
            <li>Start designing.</li>
        </ul>
        Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find, Use an easy-to-read font for blocks of text.<br>
        Choose a background color and text color that contrast well, Make sure your site fits the screen.<br>
        Keep your website light so that it loads quickly, Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the page, <br>
        Keep styles and colors consistent across the website, Make copy clear and concise, Make notes about what to
        include in the style sheet as you design,<br> as you want to keep style and function separate and lastly You
        should also design with the future in mind.

        <ul>
            <li>Test it out.</li>
        </ul>
        Testing is important for getting out bugs out and catching details,Test it on your cell phone, <br>
        your tablet, and your colleague’s cell phones and tablets too.

        <ul>
            <li>Maintain your site.</li>
        </ul>
        Once your site is launched, the work isn’t over. A website is an ongoing entity that continuously represents
        your company,<br>
        so maintenance is very important.

    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h3>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b> Misalignment with business processes:</b> <br>
                Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience,<br>
                but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very
                likely to fail.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b> Lack of cross-functional expertise: </b><br>
                Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital
                people.”<br>
                But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and
                plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Limited digital strategy:</b><br>
                Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than
                contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals.<br>
                Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s
                business strategy before moving forward.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Fixed plans that don’t account for change:</b><br>
                The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks
                and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting.<br>
                Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and
                the market at any given moment.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <b>Overambition:</b> <br>
                Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in
                projects that drag on way past their scope.<br>
                Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how
                the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>

    <h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right
        kind of technology for the job? </h3>
    <p>

    <h3>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How
        has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
    </h3>
    <p>
        Trello surely helped me organize my ideas and it was very effective with managing my time .<br>
        Git and GitHub is a very useful tool for group work or to save your work if you want to edit or try
        something<br>
        new and not lose your actual work
    </p>

    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital
        projects?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The Internet is a wonderful source of information and entertainment, <br>
        but it’s important to realise that there are a number of restrictions on what you can and cannot do online.
    </p>
    <p>There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other digital content,
        including music and videos.<br>
        Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times
        a media file can be copied or converted to another format.<br>
        When you buy software, you will normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor do
        you have the right to copy it.<br>
        Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>Legal constraints on online behaviour include protection of children legislation which prohibits grooming and
        inappropriate behaviour towards minors.<br>
        You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended conduct
        of users in various online environments.<br>
        Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or
        offline.
