    <h3> 1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">Information technology (IT) has become a vital and integral part of every business plan.<br>
        multinational corporations who maintain mainframe systems and databases to small businesses that own a single
        computer, IT plays a role.<br>
        The reasons for the omnipresent use of computer technology in business can best be determined by looking at how
        it is being used across the business world.

    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully<br> – what do you
        need

            <li> Excellent Communication Skills</li>

            and clients so that you can devise appropriate communication plans that connect with different personality
            types.</p>

            haven’t got it. <br>
            However, it’s a skill that any effective project manager needs to have.</p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li> Very Organised</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph"> Being organised is not only something I personally take pride in, it’s a vital skill for a
            role in project
            management.</p>
        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li> Works Well Under Pressure</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="paragraph"> Project Managers are ultimately responsible for delivering a project on time and within
            budget.<br>
            So, it’s important to remember how to tolerate pressure and not to become overwhelmed by it.<br><br>

    </p>

    <p>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li> Set your purpose and goals. </li>

            What is the purpose of your website?<br>
            Is it to gain publicity for your business? To sell your inventory? To rally support behind a cause?<br>
            It’s important to identify your website’s purpose, as well as your target audience.

            <br>
            Interface Design Costs, Responsiveness, Creation and Insertion Costs, Expect For the Additional Costing
            and
            Don't <br>
            Forget the Maintenance & Updating Cost.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Assign roles.</li>
            Company stakeholders (owner, marketing manager, or whoever else represents a primary

            Web developer, Content writer and/or editor, HTML/CSS professional and Web and graphic designer
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li> Create a content strategy.</li>

            The content will you be displaying on your website, Content is basically anything that
            gives your visitors
            information. <br>
            It can include, Blog posts, Documents, Video, Pictures (such as in a gallery), Slideshows and Embedded
            social
            media feeds (such as your Twitter stream or Facebook page updates)
        </ul>


        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Structure your website.</li>
            Decide what pages you’ll be using and what features will be on each one.<br>
            Most websites have an About and Contact page, but the pages you use should meet your business’ needs.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Create a mock-up.</li>
            A page mock-up, also know as a wireframe, is essentially the outline of your website (with
            the initial design
            being the first draft).<br>
            Usually created in Photoshop or Fireworks, you don’t have to put too much detail into your mock-up. Use
            placeholder text to fill pages, and don’t worry about details.<br>
            This is just to give everyone an idea of what the website will look like.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Start designing.</li>

            Make your navigation easy to understand and easy to find, Use an easy-to-read font for
            blocks of text.<br>
            Choose a background color and text color that contrast well, Make sure your site fits the screen.<br>
            Keep your website light so that it loads quickly, Make the company logo and tag line prominent on the
            page,
            <br>
            Keep styles and colors consistent across the website, Make copy clear and concise, Make notes about what
            to
            include in the style sheet as you design,<br> as you want to keep style and function separate and lastly
            You
            should also design with the future in mind.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Test it out.</li>
            Testing is important for getting out bugs out and catching details,Test it on your
            cell
            phone, <br>
            your tablet, and your colleague’s cell phones and tablets too.
        </ul>

        <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>Maintain your site.</li>
            Once your site is launched, the work isn’t over. A website is an ongoing entity that
            continuously represents
            your company,<br>
            so maintenance is very important.
        </ul>

    <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
        <ol>
            <li class="paragraph">
                Misalignment with business processes:<br>
                Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience,<br>
                but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, <br>the initiative is
                very
                likely to fail.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Lack of cross-functional expertise: <br>
                Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital
                people.”<br>
                But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope
                and<br>
                plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Limited digital strategy:<br>
                Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, <br> rather
                than
                contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals.<br>
                Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s
                business strategy before moving forward.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Fixed plans that don’t account for change:<br>
                The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks
                and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting.<br>
                Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and
                the market at any given moment.<br><br>
            </li>

            <li class="paragraph">
                Overambition: <br>
                Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in
                projects that drag on way past their scope.<br>
                Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how
                the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing.<br><br>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3> 1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software <br> – how do you select the right
        kind of technology for the job? </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">

        Researching and looking for the right technology that is suitable for the project’s needs and features,
        considering the project’s budget.<br>
        However, in this project we chose visual studio code to build the website. The reason we chose this platform is
        because it supports hundreds of languages, <br>
        also includes great tooling for web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript..


    </p>

    <h3>
        1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.<br> –
        How
        has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control
    </h3>
    <p class="paragraph">
        Trello surely helped me organize my ideas and it was very effective with managing my time. However, <br>
        one of the most helpful features was archiving the trello board to use it later on different projects.<br>
        Git and GitHub is a very useful tool to save your work if you want to edit it or try something new and not lose
        your actual work <br>
        and it’s also helpful for group work.

    </p>

    <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects<br>
        – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
    </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">There are significant legal constraints on the uploading and downloading of software and other
        digital
        content,<br>
        including music and videos.<br>
        Many items are copyright and can incorporate digital rights management, such as restricting the number of times
        a media file can be copied or converted to another format.<br>
        When you buy software, you will normally receive a licence to use it. You do not own the software itself, nor
        do<br>
        you have the right to copy it.<br>
        Some types of licence, including freeware and shareware impose fewer restrictions.
    </p>
    <p class="paragraph">
        You should ensure that you are familiar with the rules of “netiquette” which describes the recommended
        conduct<br>
        of users in various online environments.<br>
        Remember that libellous behaviour is subject to the same restrictions (and penalties) whether it is online or
        offline.
