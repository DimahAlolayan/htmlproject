        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Dimah Alolayan, computer science student. Coding and programming are my passion
            I'm an advanced java programmer, still learning python, javascript and swift.<br>
            I came all the way from saudi arabia for code nation only, the reason why I came this far because I found
            what I was looking for, which is a place who can create employable talent.<br>
            My experience here at code nation is one of the best experiences I have ever had! <br>
            The vibe & the people at code nation are very encouraging and make you want to produce more work.
