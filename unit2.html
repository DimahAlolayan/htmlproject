    <h3> 1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
    <p class="paragraph">

        Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict<br>
        what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original
        author,<br>
        second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission
        <br>
        to publish an excerpt from the original site.

        1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - <br>
        describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them

    </h3>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Blindness:<br>
        images that do not have alt text<br>
        complex images (e.g., graphs or charts) that are not adequately described<br>
        video that is not described in text or audio<br><br>

        To access the Web, most individuals who are blind rely on screen readers (software that reads text on the
        screen<br>
        with a synthetic voice) and / or refreshable braille displays (a device that dynamically displays lines of text
        on<br>
        the screen in braille). Some people who are blind prefer text-based browsers to graphical browsers.<br><br>

        Color Blindness:<br>
        color that is used as a unique marker to emphasize text on a Web site<br>
        text that inadequately contrasts with background color or patterns<br>
        browsers that do not support user override of authors' style sheets<br><br>

        To use the Web, people with color blindness may use their own style sheets to override the font and
        background<br>
        color choices of the author.
